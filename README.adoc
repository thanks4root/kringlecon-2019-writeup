- Hi, I'm Bushy Evergreen. Welcome to Elf U!
- I'm glad you're here. I'm the target of a terrible trick.
- Pepper Minstix is at it again, sticking me in a text editor.
- Pepper is forcing me to learn ed.
- Even the hint is ugly. Why can't I just use Gedit?
- Please help me just quit the grinchy thing.

(Bushy Evergreen - POST)
-Wow, that was much easier than I'd thought.
-Maybe I don't need a clunky GUI after all!
-Have you taken a look at the password spray attack artifacts?
-I'll bet that DeepBlueCLI tool is helpful.
-You can check it out on GitHub.
-It was written by that Eric Conrad.
-He lives in Maine - not too far from here!
