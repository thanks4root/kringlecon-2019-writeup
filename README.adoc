- This is a little embarrassing, but I need your help.
- Our KringleCon turtle dove mascots are missing!
- They probably just wandered off.
- Can you please help find them?
- To help you search for them and get acquainted with KringleCon, I’ve created some objectives for you. You can see them in your badge.
- Where's your badge? Oh! It's that big, circle emblem on your chest - give it a tap!
- We made them in two flavors - one for our new guests, and one for those who've attended both KringleCons.
- After you find the Turtle Doves and complete objectives 2-5, please come back and let me know.
- Not sure where to start? Try hopping around campus and talking to some elves.
- If you help my elves with some quicker problems, they'll probably remember clues for the objectives.

- Hi, I'm Bushy Evergreen. Welcome to Elf U!
- I'm glad you're here. I'm the target of a terrible trick.
- Pepper Minstix is at it again, sticking me in a text editor.
- Pepper is forcing me to learn ed.
- Even the hint is ugly. Why can't I just use Gedit?
- Please help me just quit the grinchy thing.

(Bushy Evergreen - POST)
-Wow, that was much easier than I'd thought.
-Maybe I don't need a clunky GUI after all!
-Have you taken a look at the password spray attack artifacts?
-I'll bet that DeepBlueCLI tool is helpful.
-You can check it out on GitHub.
-It was written by that Eric Conrad.
-He lives in Maine - not too far from here!
