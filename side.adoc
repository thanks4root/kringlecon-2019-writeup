- Hi, I'm Bushy Evergreen. Welcome to Elf U!
- I'm glad you're here. I'm the target of a terrible trick.
- Pepper Minstix is at it again, sticking me in a text editor.
- Pepper is forcing me to learn ed.
- Even the hint is ugly. Why can't I just use Gedit?
- Please help me just quit the grinchy thing.

(Bushy Evergreen - POST)
-Wow, that was much easier than I'd thought.
-Maybe I don't need a clunky GUI after all!
-Have you taken a look at the password spray attack artifacts?
-I'll bet that DeepBlueCLI tool is helpful.
-You can check it out on GitHub.
-It was written by that Eric Conrad.
-He lives in Maine - not too far from here!

==== Solution

. Noted that the three worn digits were `1, 3, 7`
. Looked at what `Tangle Coalbox` told me
.. One digit is repeated once
.. Code is a prime number
. The available numbers made me think of *leet* speak
. Remembered that `1337` is not prime -- but `7331` is

NOTE: *Answer*: `7331`

- Hey kid, it's me, Tangle Coalbox.
- I'm sleuthing again, and I could use your help.
- Ya see, this here number lock's been popped by someone.
- I think I know who, but it'd sure be great if you could open this up for me.
- I've got a few clues for you.
-- One digit is repeated once.
-- The code is a prime number.
-- You can probably tell by looking at the keypad which buttons are used.

(Tangle Coalbox - POST)
- Yep, that's it. Thanks for the assist, gumshoe.
- Hey, if you think you can help with another problem, Prof. Banas could use a hand too.
- Head west to the other side of the quad into Hermey Hall and find him in the Laboratory.

- Hi! I'm Minty Candycane!
- I just LOVE this old game!
- I found it on a 5 1/4" floppy in the attic.
- You should give it a go!
- If you get stuck at all, check out this year's talks.
- If you get stuck at all, check out this year's talks.
- One is about web application penetration testing.
- Good luck, and don't get dysentery!


(Minty Candycane - POST)
- You made it - congrats!
- Have you played with the key grinder in my room? Check it out!
- It turns out: if you have a good image of a key, you can physically copy it.
- Maybe you'll see someone hopping around with a key here on campus.
- Sometimes you can find it in the Network tab of the browser console.
- Deviant has a great talk on it at this year's Con.
- He even has a collection of key bitting templates for common vendors like Kwikset, Schlage, and Yale.
